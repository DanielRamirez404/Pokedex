# Pokedex
A small pokedex program to practice dynamic arrays (aka vectors) in C++ and also for me to start learning git

I finished this program not so long ago (probably like two weeks ago), but an error sometimes would appear out of the blue
It seems to have something to do with C++ string convertions, since it would throw me an error from the standard library featuring static_cast
I decided to move on, since I had already achieved my goal with this program, and maybe come back some months later to make a rework with more features

I decided to make my own dynamic_array class, since, in doing so, it would let me fully grasp how vectors work from a low level standpoint
The program was kind of an excuse to make me work with vectors. I'm looking forward to do the same thing with linked lists and other data structures.
